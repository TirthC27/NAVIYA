# Production build – set the real value in Vercel Environment Variables.
# This file acts as a fallback / documentation placeholder.
# In Vercel dashboard, set:
#   VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://<your-render-service>.onrender.com
#
# Leave the value empty here so the build fails loudly if the
# Vercel env var is not configured (rather than silently using localhost).
